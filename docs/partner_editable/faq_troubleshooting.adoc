== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack‚Äôs state is retained and the instance remains running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (Look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)

*Important:* When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Ensure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^].

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a non-S3 location, you might encounter template size limitations when you create the stack. For more information about AWS CloudFormation limits, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation^].

*Q.* I am not able to delete the stack that I created from the Quick Start.

*A.* We recommend that you clean up the registry bucket in your S3 account and retry deleting the stack.
