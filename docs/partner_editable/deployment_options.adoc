This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings, as discussed later in this guide.


== Step 1. Sign up for a Red Hat subscription

This Quick Start requires a Red Hat subscription. During the deployment of the Quick Start, provide your https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws/installer-provisioned[OpenShift installer-provisioned infrastructure pull secret].

If you don‚Äôt have a Red Hat account, you can register for one through the Red Hat website. (Registration may require a non-personal email address). To procure a 60-day evaluation license for OpenShift, follow the instructions at https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it[Evaluate Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform].

The https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws/installer-provisioned[OpenShift pull secret] should be uploaded to an S3 bucket. The Quick Start pulls this secret file from the specified S3 bucket location to provision the cluster.

== Step 2. Cloud Pak for Data subscription

When you deploy the Quick Start, you can enable the production instance by entering the API key, which comes as part of the Cloud Pak for Data entitlement. If you don't have a paid entitlement, you can create a https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-42212[60-day trial subscription key].

*Note:* After 60 days, please contact https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=MAIL-cloud[IBM Cloud Pak for Data sales].
