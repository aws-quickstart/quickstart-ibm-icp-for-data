You can get started with a 60-day trial or use your existing {partner-product-short-name} entitlement. Additional costs depend on the storage type for your platform. You can choose among three storage classes: Amazon EFS, Portworx, or OCS. EFS costs are charged automatically to your AWS account. You have an option to use a Portworx trial version or an evaluation version of OCS. Visit https://portworx.com/products/features/[Portworx^] or https://www.openshift.com/products/container-storage/contact[OCS^] for licensed versions.
