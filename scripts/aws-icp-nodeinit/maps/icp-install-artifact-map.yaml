# Every bucket is expected to have a folder in it for each ICP version that
# is currently supported. Each version folder will have the following attributes:
# VERSION: - the ICP version, e.g., 3.1.0, 3.1.1, etc
#   icp-base-install-archive: - name of the icp base isntall tar ball
#   docker-install-binary:    - name of the docker install binary file
#   inception-image-name:     - the name of the inception image
#   inception-command:        - the inception command string
#   fixpack:
#     file-name:              - the name of the fixpack file (.tar file)
#     fixpack-executable:     - the name of the fixpack executable (.sh file)
#     inception-image-name:   - the fixpack inception image name
#     inception-command:      - the fixpack inception command string
#
# For file transfer efficiency, each AWS region has a bucket.
# The s3-buckets table maps regions to bucket names.
# 
# By convention the bucket names are ibm-cloud-private-REGION
# where REGION is the region name.  Whatever the bucket name 
# actually is, it needs to be reflected in this yaml file.
# NOTE: S3 bucket names must be globally unique.  There is no
# scoping of bucket names even at account boundaries.
