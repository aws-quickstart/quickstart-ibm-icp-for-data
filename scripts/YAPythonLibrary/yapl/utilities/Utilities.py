def getInputArgs(argsSignature,args=None):

    Return a dictionary with the strings in sys.argv processed as name-value pairs or "switch" keyword args.
    
    NOTE: When running wsadmin, sys.argv[0] is the first actual argument, not the name of the script being invoked.
    However, when running with Jython directly, the first argument is the name of the Jython script.  An exception 
    will be raised because if the name of the script is not listed in the argsSignature dictionary.  The simplest 
    thing to do when running with Jython directly is to pass in sys.argv[1:].
              
    Input: An args "signature" dictionary with the keyword entries in it and the expected type of the argument value. 
    The recognized types are:
        string, integer, int, float, boolean and switch.
  
    A "switch" type argument is one that is a keyword only and doesn't have a value.  If it is present in the argv list, 
    a boolean true (1) is assigned to its corresponding arg name.

    The keywords in the arg signature are assumed to begin with a dash (-) or a double dash (--).  (The double dash is 
    occasionally necessary to avoid conflicts with the wsadmin command line args, e.g. --help to emit usage info. The
    dashes are stripped off to create an arg name when assigning key-value pairs in the output dictionary of actual args.

    If a string type keyword appears more than once in the argsv[] array, then a list of values for that keyword is created 
    for that entry in the output dictionary.  This is handy for writing scripts where you want to be able to allow the user 
    repeat a particular argument multiple times so as to provide a list.  The other approach to providing a list is to use a 
    comma or space separated string and then create the list with split.  We didn't provide this capability for the other 
    types of arguments since we couldn't come up with a realistic scenario for passing in a list of numbers or booleans 
    using multiple keyword args.  If we do, we'll modify the method.

    NOTE: If a script has all optional arguments then the args argument may end up being the empty list.  We explicitly check 
    for args == None to cover cases where no args at all are passed in and in that case sys.argv is used for args. Be careful 
    when using Jython directly, because sys.argv[0] holds the name of the Jython script.  It is recommended that the caller pass 
    in sys.argv[1:] when running with Jython directly.  When running with wsadmin, the first element in sys.argv is stripped off 
    by wsadmin.

def splitString(string,separators=StringSeparators):
  """
    The splitString() method is used to create a Jython list from a string of whatever
    is passed in the string.  This could be a list of names or a list of numbers and names
    or whatever.  The string argument can be an string that contains an arbitrary set of 
    substrings separated by the given separators.  
    
    It is often convenient to use a string to represent a list, e.g., on the command line.  
    The separator within that string can be any of the characters provided in the separators 
    argument. The separators argument defaults to those defined in the NameSeparators global 
    for this module. 
    
    The splitString method originated as support for things coming in on the command
    line to a top level script or from a properties file where a multi-valued property
    is needed.
    
    The given string is split into a list based on the separators provided.  Separators 
    defaults to NameSeparators which is comma (,) or space ( ) or a plus (+) character 
    in that order of precedence. If the given string has a comma character in it, the 
    split is done on the comma character. If the given string has a space character in 
    it the split is done on the space character, etc.
    
    NOTE: If the items in the string list have space characters in them, then
    obviously + or , needs to be used to delimit the different items in the
    string.  
    
    With respect to WAS configuration objects we strongly advise against 
    using names that have space characters in the name. Using spaces in names leads 
    to nothing but headaches in scripting.
    
    NOTE: If the incoming string doesn't have any of the separator characters in it, 
    the result is a list with the incoming things string as the only member.  This is 
    behavior patterned after the way the Jython split() method works.
    
    NOTE: To avoid situations where extra space characters are included or somehow 
    an empty item resulted from the split operation, a "clean-up" step is done at the end 
    to filter out any empty values and to strip white space off the items in the result list.  
    This takes care of strings that look like "foo, bar, baz" which would result in 
    ['foo', ' bar', ' baz'] which isn't likely what is wanted.  It also takes care of something 
    that happens to have a double space in it such as "foo  bar baz" which would result in 
    ['foo', '', 'bar', 'baz'] which also isn't likely what is wanted.
