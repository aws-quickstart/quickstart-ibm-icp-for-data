# File Name:    Trace.py 
# Description:  This file contains a trace class developed for use with WebSphere Application 
# Server wsadmin scripting.  However, there is nothing in this module implementation that
# is specific to wsadmin or WebSphere Application Server.  The module code is straight Jython
# and fully self contained, i.e., it relies on no other script modules.
#  
# Author:	Peter Van Sickel pvs@us.ibm.com
#
# History:
#    This Trace implementation has been around in various forms for some time as indicated
#    by the history.  There were significant enhancements to it in 2011 and 2012.
#
#        19 SEP 2009 - pvs - Pulling this together from previous work.
#
#        05 NOV 2009 - pvs
#           Added the source line number as part of standard trace output.  
#           Added a "module" parameter to the trace constructor.  
#           The new approach to using the Trace class is to now have a 
#           TR instance in each module instead of one global instance.
#           Added entry and exit methods.  I didn't realize I hadn't defined
#           an entry and exit method.
#
#        05 JAN 2011 - pvs
#           Added additional levels and corresponding methods to conform to 
#           java.util.logging.Level trace levels.  This makes this trace class 
#           intuitive for Java programmers.
#           
#           Also introduced the _log() method to consolidate the actual trace
#           emitting code into one method.
#
#        12 MAY 2011 - pvs
#           Added the option to send trace to a file both in the constructor
#           as a logFile parameter and using a setter method.
#           The logFile parameter is a string that is a fully qualified path.
#           The logFile is opened and the file descriptor stored in a class
#           attribute named logFile so all trace for all instances will be sent 
#           to that file.
#
#        21 SEP 2011 - pvs
#           Moved traceLevels out of the instance for each Trace and into
#           the Trace class.  The traceLevels dictionary certainly doesn't
#           need to be created for each Trace instance.  Modified the 
#           references to traceLevels accordingly.
#
#        16 JAN 2012 - pvs
#           Added an eventType to the output to provide a 1 character visual
#           cue regarding the "type" of the particular trace that is emitted.
#           The event type code is the same used in the WAS runtime tracing.
#
#        25 JAN 2012 - pvs
#           Added an isLoggable(Level) method to support the ability
#           to do a quick query on the log level before actually invoking
#           a trace method to cut down on overhead of the trace method
#           invocation building its arg strings, etc.  Similar to Java
#           logging framework.
#
#           Also did some refactoring that led to adding a couple of helper
#           methods: _coerceLevel, _isTraceLevel.  This is part of an effort
#           to move to using the Level class constants rather than the string
#           names for the trace levels.  However, both are transparently
#           supported.
#
#        28 JAN 2012 - pvs
#           Added the optional "exc" (exception) argument to severe() and 
#           error() and as an optional argument to _log().  When exc is passed
#           to _log() the exception message and a stack dump is included in the 
#           trace string.  Including the stack dump for error() and severe()
#           conforms to WAS tracing conventions.  See the Jython/Python doc
#           on the traceback module.  This exception stack trace code is based
#           on work from John Martinek.
#
#        16 FEB 2012 - pvs
#           Moved the methods to open and close the trace file into the Trace 
#           class. Now those methods are available in the Trace module namespace 
#           and the Trace class namespace.  This is intended to be a convenience
#           modification only.  The trace file is still a class level object
#           used by all instances.
#
#        26 APR 2012 - pvs
#           Replaced Trace methods entry() with entering() and exit() with exiting().  
#           The exit() method name uses a Jython/Python keyword.  The method names 
#           entering() and exiting() are preferred for conformance with Java Logger.  
#           Also cleaned up some other indentation warnings and unused variable warn-
#           ings. In _sourceFrame() method, replaced a deprecated use of sys.exc_traceback 
#           with a call to sys.exc_info()[2]
#
#        01 MAY 2012 - pvs
#           Added the use of a lock in the Trace._log() method to synchronize the
#           file IO statements (write, flush).  I discovered through use of Trace
#           in notification handlers (which execute on separate threads) that 
#           things can get messed up in the trace log depending on when different
#           threads jump in to do output.
#
#        06 SEP 2012 - pvs
#           John Martinek added a thread ID to the trace string.  This becomes 
#           useful for scenarios where multiple threads are emitting trace.  
#           John had also made some code corrections to keep the error message
#           with the stack dump for exception traces in multi-threaded trace
#           scenarios.  The original code emitted the error message in one
#           place and the stack dump in a second place.  Also made the exc
#           argument for error() and severe() optional and set to None by
#           default.
#
#        07 - 14 SEP 2012 - pvs
#           Made a number of changes to clean up the Trace implementation in 
#           preparation for releasing it as part of a dW article.  I simplified
#           the API here and there.  Renamed the exception classes to follow
#           a better naming convention that included the word Exception as the
#           last word of the class name.
#
#           The  most important addition was to add the ability to control trace 
#           using trace strings as is done with WebSphere Application Server. I 
#           had been wanting to implement that sort of thing for a good while 
#           and finally did it.
#
#           Modified the Trace constructor to require an "entity" name which 
#           is the name of a module or class being traced.  An exception is 
#           thrown if the entity name is empty or None.  The entity argument
#           to the constructor is required.  This moved the Trace class from
#           a focus on tracing modules to a focus on tracing modules and classes.
#           The original module focus had its roots in Java in that each file
#           holds only one class definition.  But in Jython a file (module) may
#           hold multiple class definitions so there may be a Trace instance for
#           each class defined in that module.
#
#           Modified the Trace constructor to remove the log file as a keyword
#           parameter.  It turns out it is much more common and "natural" to open 
#           a log file based on a command line input parameter and then use the 
#           a Trace instance method or the Trace module method to open the log 
#           file for writing (truncate existing) or appending.
#
#           Modified the Trace constructor to take only an integer constant for
#           the level keyword argument.  The level keyword argument also defaults
#           to Level.INFO.  Removed support in the constructor for a string form
#           of a trace level.  (Using the Trace constructor to set the trace level
#           for a given entity is not recommended except in "quick-and-dirty" 
#           scenarios.  See elsewhere in the comments for the recommended approach.)
#
#      19 APR 2013
#           PVS - Added an option varable to the class that controls whether stack 
#           traces are provided from "top-to-bottom" (TTB) or "bottom to top" (BTT).
#           The default is TTB which is a Java style stack trace. The BTT option is
#           Python/Jython style of stack trace.  There is a method that is used to
#           create the stack representation from TTB as well as a method to create
#           the stack BTT.
#  NOTES:
#     In the trace methods, integer constants as defined in the Level class are used to 
#     avoid the overhead of using the dictionary with the named trace levels in it.
#  
#  Trace levels are ordered from "lower" to "higher" with lower trace levels being 
#  considered more important to emit such as for errors, warnings and "info" and higher 
#  trace levels reserved for debugging, such as config, fine, finer, finest.
# 
#  If no log file has been defined, then all trace levels are emitted to stdout which 
#  usually means it shows up in the command window where the script was launched.
#  (Obviously, it could be redirected to a file.)
#
#  If a log file has been configured, then all trace goes to the log file.  And only 
#  trace at INFO level and "lower" goes to stdout, i.e., error, warning and info.
#
# The format of the trace line is:
# [<datetimestamp>] <threadid> T <entityname>(<linenumber>) <methodname> : <message>
#   where T is a one character event type
#   <entityname> is the module or class being traced (see more on this below)
#
# NOTE: <entityname> does not get truncated as in WAS trace.  We opted to emit the 
# entire name to make it easy to determine which module or class is emitting the
# the trace.
#
#  Usage example:
#  Somewhere at the top of module put the import statement:
#
#     from was.admin.utilities.Trace import Trace,Level
#
#  Note: The import statement shown above assumes the package and library directory 
#  structure of a library of modules that includes the Trace module.  Your import 
#  statement should reflect your specific runtime and library structure.  If the 
#  Trace module is in the same directory as the module using it, the import will 
#  look like:
#
#     from Trace import Trace,Level
#
#  Trace constructor signature: __init__(self,entity,level=Level.INFO)
#  Note: An entity name (module or class name) is required.
#        level must be one of the constants defined by the Level class.
#
#  When creating a Trace instance for a module, initialize a Trace instance for the 
#  module.
#
#     TR = Trace(__name__)
#
#  When creating an instance of Trace for a class within a module it is recommended
#  that the module name be incorporated into the entity name provided to the Trace
#  constructor.  If a class level variable is preferred:
#     class MyClass:
#       TR = Trace("%s.MyClass" % __name__)
#
#  If an instance variable is preferred, then in the body of the __init__ method for
#  the class:
#     class MyClass:
#       def __init__(self, ...):
#         self.TR = Trace("%s.MyClass" % __name__)
#         ...
#       #endDef
#       ...
#     #endClass
#
#  For a class level variable the Trace instance will be referenced using the class name
#  as a qualifier.  For an instance level variable the Trace instance will be referenced 
#  using "self" as the qualifier.
#
#  Using the module name (__name__) as part of the entity name argument for the Trace
#  constructor helps greatly to avoid name collisions when each trace instance registers 
#  itself in the "tracedEntities" class variable that is ultimately used to enable trace 
#  levels using trace strings.  In short, the "entity name" (module or class name) for each 
#  Trace instance needs to be unique.  (Jython packages also help to ensure module and class
#  name uniqueness.)
#
#  Always use the module __name__ builtin rather than an explicit module name
#  string to avoid issues if the module name is changed or if you end up using a
#  module in a library organized in Jython packages and the package names get
#  refactored or the module gets exported out to a flat collection of files.
#
#  <Thoughts_on_how_to_define_Trace_instances>
#
#  If there is only one traced class definition in a given module, then a module level
#  Trace instance is likely sufficient.  However, if you define multiple classes in 
#  a module, and more than one class needs to use Trace, then it is recommended that a 
#  separate Trace instance be created for each class.
#
#  It is recommended that each "major" class (that would use Trace) be defined in its 
#  own file and thus always use module level instances of Trace.  This makes it easy to 
#  reference the Trace instance variable without a qualifier when invoking a Trace method,
#  e.g., TR.info(). Minor supporting classes that might be in the same file don't usually 
#  get traced because they are simple.  If a supporting class is or becomes complex enough 
#  that Trace is needed then that class likely deserves its own module.  Refactor the 
#  original module into multiple modules, one for each "complex" class and continue to 
#  use a module level Trace instance for each class.
#
#  If you want to define a Trace instance for a class, recommend using a class level 
#  Trace instance over an instance level, as it seems unnecessary to incur the overhead 
#  of instantiating a Trace instance for each instance of a class.
#
#  If the class name is annoyingly long for descriptive purposes, either refactor the name 
#  into something shorter (that hopefully does not sacrifice its descriptiveness), or assign
#  the class to a variable with a short name, e.g., 
#      thisClass = MyClassWithADescriptiveName
#  Or even shorter:
#      tC = MyClassWithADescriptiveName
#  Then you can reference the Trace instance as:
#      thisClass.TR.info(...)
#  Or
#      tC.TR.info(...)
#  
#  </Thoughts_on_how_to_define_Trace_instances>
#
#  In the bodies of methods where you want trace, define a variable named
#  methodName at the top of the method and assign the method name to it:
#    def myMethod(...):
#      """documentation string for the method..."""
#      methodName = "myMethod"
#
#      TR.entering(methodName)
#      ... 
#      TR.info(methodName,"My trace message.")
#      ...
#      TR.exiting(methodName)
#    #endDef
#  If you change a method name, be sure to remember to change the static string
#  value assigned to methodName.
#
# For traces that are at levels above "info" it is typical to use the isLoggable()
# method to avoid even the overhead of making the call to the Trace method, e.g.,
#
#    if (TR.isLoggable(Level.FINEST)):
#      TR.finest(methodName,"trace message that likely involves string construction")
#    #endIf
#
# It is often the case that you want trace to go to a log file.  To always append
# trace to a log file use:
#         TR.appendTraceLog(logPath)
#         where logPath is a string that is the path to the file.
#
# There is also a method to open the logfile and truncate any existing content
# from previous uses of the log file:
#         TR.openTraceLog(logPath)
#
# NOTE: The logFile is a Trace class level variable and thus all instances of Trace
# write to the same log file.  You can open a log file with instance methods or 
# module methods.  Usually the instance methods are the most convenient. Opening a 
# log file is something you want to control based on command line arguments to a top 
# level "main" class for your script, for example, using -logfile <file_path> as a
# command line parameter.
#
# There are a couple of different ways to set the trace level for a given Trace 
# instance. The Trace class constructor has a keyword parameter named "level" that 
# can be used when the module trace class is instantiated.  The trace class also
# has a method to set trace to a specific level:
#
#         TR.setTraceLevel(level)
#
#         where level is either a string that is one of the valid trace levels
#         or level is one of the levels defined in the Level class, e.g.,
#
#         TR.setTraceLevel(Level.FINER)
#
# You can set the trace level in other modules (for example from a top level
# script), by importing that module and then using the trace global variable
# in that module.  For example, assume TR is the global variable that implements
# the Trace instance in a module named ServerCluster. An import of 
# the ServerCluster module is included in your script that is using it:
#
#       import was.admin.clusters.ServerCluster as ServerCluster
#
# Setting the trace level in that module is done as follows:
#
#       ServerCluster.TR.setTraceLevel(Level.FINEST)
#
# The above methods are relatively awkward and not recommended except in "quick and 
# dirty" scenarios.  The above methods tend to require code modifications to get a 
# different trace level or to enable trace in a different module that you decide you 
# need to trace. In other words the above methods don't readily support a dynamic 
# method of enabling trace across a wide range of modules that may be in use for a 
# given script.  The above methods were all that was available until the Trace
# class was enhanced to support the use of a trace specification string, which is 
# described next.
#
# The recommended approach for enabling trace for a collection of modules is to use 
# a command line argument to your main script that has a trace string specification 
# as its value.  Then use the module or Trace instance method configureTrace(traceString) 
# to set trace levels based on the given traceString.  So for example your main program 
# can support a
#     -trace <trace_string> 
# command line argument. Your command line processing code will parse through
# the "argv" array (sys.argv) and if it encounters the -trace keyword then it 
# takes the next element of argv to be the trace string.  Assume the value of 
# the trace string is stored in a variable named traceString.  Then traceString 
# can be passed into either the Trace instance instantiated for your main 
# module, e.g., 
#      TR.configureTrace(traceString)
# or the module level Trace method could be invoked assuming an import
# of the trace module as follows:
#      import Trace as TraceModule
#      ...
#      TraceModule.configureTrace(traceString)      
#
# See the module comments below near the definition of traceSpec and traceString
# in the Trace class for specifics on the syntax of the trace string.  In short 
# the trace string syntax is the same as that used by WebSphere Application Server
# without the "state" part.  (The state part is the "=enabled" or "=disabled" which
# fell out of favor along about version 7 of WAS.)

# List of module level methods:
#    openTraceLog(logPath)   - opens for write, the trace log file with the 
#                              given path; truncates the existing file
#    appendTraceLog(logPath) - opens for append, the trace log file with the 
#                              given path
#    closeTraceLog()         - closes the trace log file
#
#    parseTraceString(traceString) - parse the given trace string into a list 
#                                    of TraceSpecification instances
#                                    This method is not likely to be commonly
#                                    used. This method is used by other module
#                                    level methods and could be used to explore
#                                    the trace string parsing.
#
#   setTraceSpec(traceString) - Set Trace.traceSpec based on the given traceString.
#                               This is not intended for common use.
#
#   getTraceSpec()            - Get the value of Trace.traceSpec.
#
#   configureTrace(traceString) - Use this method to configure trace levels in all 
#                                 registered Trace instances based on the given traceString.
#                                 Assuming the usage pattern of instantiating a Trace instance
#                                 as a global in a module, the module Trace instances are 
#                                 instantiated and the module is "registered" when a module is 
#                                 imported. Trace levels will be set based on the given traceString
#                                 for all registered trace instances at the time configureTrace()
#                                 is invoked. Trace instances that are instantiated at some later
#                                 run time will also check the traceSpec as part of the Trace
#                                 instantiation.
#
# NOTE: The above trace log methods are implemented as Trace class methods as
# well.  It is usually convenient to use the instance level methods for opening 
# and closing the trace log file.

  #
  # For details on the syntax of the trace string, see the WAS InfoCenter section titled,

  #     <module_package> = <name>[.<name>]*
  #     <level> is one of the trace levels
  # 
  # Use a colon to separate multiple trace strings. An asterisk may be used to
  # terminate a trace string to enable trace for all the modules in a given family
  # as per the Jython package name, e.g., was.admin.*=all sets the trace level to 
  # "all" for all modules in the was.admin package and any of its sub-packages.
  # Another example of a trace string is:
  #     was.admin.clusters.ServerCluster=finer:was.admin.clusters.ClusterMember=fine
  # A wild-card could be used to set trace to fine for all modules in the 
  # was.admin.clusters package:  was.admin.clusters.*=fine

  # was raised (thrown).  The exception stack is typically of most interest.
