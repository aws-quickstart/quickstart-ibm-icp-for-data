#
# Install docker and then start and enable it.
#
# NOTE: As of ICP v2.1.0.2 on RHEL it is required that Docker
# available in Passport Advantage (or) eXtreme Leverage is used.
# The install package is an executable binary.
# It has a pre-req that may not be installed already: policycoreutils-python
#
# NOTE: This playbook assumes the Docker install executable is located
# in /root/docker and named icp-docker-install.bin of the localhost when the 
# script is run.
#
# NOTE: Check the name of the docker install executable.  It is hard-wired
# in the script below.
#
# NOTE: This playbook is intended for use with the AWS ICP Quickstart CloudFormation
# script that makes sure for RHEL/CENTOS policycoreutils-python is installed by the 
# CF script. For ubuntu the policycoreutils-python-utils is installed by the CF script.
#
# The CloudFormation script that deploys the cluster nodes also copies the Docker
# installation binary to /root/docker/icp-docker-install.bin.  The step in the Ansible
# playbook to copy the Docker install binary from the boot node to the other nodes 
# is still there, but it should be a no-op.
#
# NOTE: Ubuntu uses overlay2 by default.  Centos and RHEL do not.  The storage driver
# is explicitly included on the ExecStart line of the docker.service file for clarity.
# 
# NOTE: The MountFlags=shared is also explicitly included in the docker.service file
# for clarity.  It could be left out all together.
#
# INPUTS:
#   vars:
#     target_nodes - a regex string or group name that defines the hosts or
#                    host group.
#
#     You can define the vars on the ansible-playbook command line using --extra-vars.
#     Or define vars in your hosts inventory or any of the other ways to define
#     Ansible variables.
#     The --inventory option can be used to provide a path to an inventory file
#     on the ansible-playbook command line.
#
# Root privilege is needed to run this configuration script.
# The tasks where root is needed use the "become" option.
#
# Sample invocation:
#   ansible-playbook install-docker.yaml --extra-vars "target_nodes=worker0*"
#
#   The above invocation assumes the ansible hosts file has nodes with
#   names that start with worker0, e.g., worker01, worker02, ...
#
