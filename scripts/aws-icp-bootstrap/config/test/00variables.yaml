# The values of the intrinsic variables are derived from the ICP deployment

# Custom variable and keyword map

kind: variables

# The VariableKeywordMap provides the mapping from the variable names
# defined in this file to the keywords used to defined macro substitutions
# in the command files.
#
# The keywords are used in the command files in the same directory 
# as this variables file.  It turns out to be convenient to have
# one level of indirection between the variable names and the macro
# names used for macro substitution in the command files.
#
# NOTE: All IntrinsicaVariables used in the command files and all variables 
# defined in the VariableValues table must have an entry in the VariableKeywordMap
#
VariableKeywordMap:
  ClusterDNSName: CLUSTER_DNS_NAME
  ProxyDNSName: PROXY_DNS_NAME
  TADB_UserName: TA_DB_USERNAME
  TADB_Password: TA_DB_SECRET
  TA_StorageClass: TA_STORAGE_CLASS

# Custom variable values
# user name and password need to be base64 encoded
# user: admin
# password: secret01
